## 🏆 A.1.2 Learning activity

**Objective**

Make a light (lux) measuring sensor by means of an electronic circuit, using a simulator, and a **LDR (Light dependent Resistor)**.

### 📘 Instructions
___

- It is suggested to use one of the following simulators for the development of this activity: [Autodesk Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [Virtual BreadBoard](https://www.virtualbreadboard.com/), [Easy EDA](https://easyeda.com/) so it will be necessary to familiarize yourself beforehand, and even to install or register within the platform.
- Any activity or challenge should be done using the **MarkDown style with extension .md** and the VSCode development environment, it must be elaborated as a document  **single page**, that is, if the document has images, links or any external document, it must be accessed from tags and links, and it must be named with the nomenclature **A1.2_TituloActividad_NombreAlumno.pdf.**
- It is required that the .MD contains a link tag to the repository of your document in github, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the end of the challenge it must be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file export to a **.pdf** file so it is be uploaded to classroom in its corresponding section, serving as evidence of your delivery, since it is the **official** platform here you will receive the grade of your activity.
- Considering that the .PDF file  was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
- Your repository must also have a **readme.md** file in its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor's data, teacher's data, and so on, and even logo or images, you must have a contents section or index, which are actually **links to your .md documents**, avoid using text to indicate internal or external links.
- We propose a structure as shown below, but you can use any other structure to help you organize your repository.

### ✏️ Development
___

1. Use the following list of materials for the elaboration of the activity and add your bibliographic link in the Source of reference column.

| **Quantity**  | **Description**                   | **Source of reference**                                                                                            |

2. Considering that the LDR element is a photoresistive sensor in other words, its resistance varies according to the amount of light that strikes it, **What do you see in the graph below?**

[<p align="center"> <img alt="Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-GitTeam/SistemasProgramables_VR4.0/master/img/C1.x_Sensor_FotoresistenciaLDR.png?token=AHMXDA3HMTEC32LBEU66FG3AJQZDC" width=600 height=300>](https://github.com/e-GitTeam/SistemasProgramables_VR4.0/blob/master/img/C1.x_Sensor_FotoresistenciaLDR.png)

  - In the first images we can observe how a real LDR looks like and also how it's represented in electronic diagrams. You can also see a lamp giving light to a photoresistance sensor and a little graph of how the resistance behaves according to the light. Then there's a more detailed graph with aproximated quantitys for Dark night time and Bright sunlight you can also see the unit of measurement for the resistance and light (ohms and lux). You can conclude that at more light the less resistance the LDR holds. 

3. Assemble the circuit shown using the simulator you have considered, placing the photoresistor in the LDR position and resistor according to the schematic image.

7. Measure the measured Vout voltage value for each of the conditions.

  **Vout for no light**

  **Vout for intensive light**
[<p align="center"> <img alt="Vout3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaaronPR/Sistemas-Programables/main/imagenes/Vout3.PNG?token=AHMXDAYBCUDSVA7YGJNO7ILAKVWWU" >](https://github.com/ShaaronPR/Sistemas-Programables/blob/main/imagenes/Vout3.PNG?raw=true)

8. Calculate the voltage accuracy value between theoretical and measured for each condition, consider including in this section the explaining of how the theoretical calculations were obtained.
  
 - Absence of light: (0.02762V / 0.0277V ) * 100 =99.71%  
 - Ambient light : (2.61V / 2.615V )* 100 = 99.8% 
 - Intense light  : (3.32V / 3.32V ) * 100 = 100%  
  
9. Measure the **resistance** of the photoresistor with the ohmmeter under the following conditions: no light or darkness, ambient light, intensive light and record in the corresponding table.

10. Calculate the **theoretical Vout voltage value** for each of the above conditions as well as the measured Vout voltage value and record in the corresponding table.

11. Calculate the **voltage accuracy value** between theoretical and measured for each condition and record in the corresponding table.

| Condition        | Impedance in photoresistance | Theoretical Vout voltage   | Measured voltage Vout  | % V.Measured/ V.Theoretical  |
|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Absence of light | 180 kΩ | 1000 / (1000 + 180000) * 5V = 0.02762V | 27.7mV | 99.71% | 
| Ambient light	   | 912 Ω | 1000 / (1000 + 912) * 5V = 2.615V | 2.61V | 99.8% |
| Intense light    | 506 Ω | 1000 / (1000 + 506) * 5V = 3.32V  | 3.32V | 100% |

Absence of light = (1000 * 5V) / (180000 + 1000) = 0.0277V
Ambient light = (1000 * 5V) / (912 + 1000) = 2.615V
Intense light = (1000 * 5V) / (506 + 1000) = 3.32V

12. Make a graph using the values recorded in the table above, where the "X" axis is the measured Vout Voltage and the "Y" axis represents the impedance at the LDR photoresistor, and **insert the graph**

14. Include individual conclusions and results observed during the development of the activity.

- Jesús Xavier López Galaz :In this activity we found that electronic is very important, also I know more about Light dependent resistors, is important to see that in the results the Measured voltage (Vout) has certain relation between the impedance in the photoresistance, so when there is more Impedance it will have less voltage Vout now this has some applications, we can use this for handle the incoming light for the photoresistance to have certain amount of illumination to be not dangerous to human eye .  Also, I understand better Autodesk Thinkercad and his tools.

- Karla Dinora Urrea Soto : Everything in each point of this practice allows us to conclude that at more light the less resistance the photoresistance sensor will hold and that will in consequence make the Vout voltage be higher as well. It was interesting seeing how it was measured in the simulator because in theory you can calculate stuff but not really grasp the concept in its entirety. I was thankful for my classmates since they made me learn and understand much better how the theory came into the circuit.

- Shaaron Porras Rangel: Once the activity was over, I could see that photoresistance works as a variable element. It was interesting to work in Tinkercad and discover how the sensors work, as I had not worked with them before. In conclusion, we can say that the sensitivity of the sensor works in the same way:"The higher the light intensity, the lower the resistance, i.e. the easier the electrons to move"

- Carlos Fernando Leal Oliva : This activity seemed very interesting to me since we can observe the different behaviors of a photoresist depending on the light that is affecting it.This helped me to better understand the photoresists and how they work, it also helped me to practice using tools such as Thinkercad and Github in collaboration with my colleagues.
